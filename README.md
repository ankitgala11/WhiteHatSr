Website related to Education &amp; Learning

There are two seperate pathways for faculty and students so that students cannot upload notices and assignments and the "freg.html" file is hidden (ghost) as there are no links on the entire website that lead you there, it's only meant for faculty members to register and can only be accessed manually by putting the file name in the URL for security reasons. 

The free courses link ---> "https://getmentored.courses/" isn't meant for publicity of any person/(s) and/or organisation and any incident as such is purely coincidental *scoffs and winks*

The spotify playlist link is actually good for "intense studying" sessions, we created this entire site while listening to the playlist on loop lol, cuz every student NEEDS music while browsing through boring assignments. 

Do checkout the back feature after clicking on "logout", i.e once the session ends, you'll be gracefully *scoffs again* requested by a special person to login again.
